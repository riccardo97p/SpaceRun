# SpaceRun

## Interactive Graphics Project for La Sapienza University course held by Marco Schaerf

This is a simple WebGL based game built using ThreeJS, TweenJS and some 3d model freely available from the web.
It's an endless running game where the player tries to achieve the best score by avoiding the obstacles he encounters into his path.
